        hi kanika <br>
        can't believe its been an year already since this day , the best day of 2023 for me. <br>
        i can still feel it, that magical moment when i held your hands , i stopped thinking for a minute all i could feel were fireworks in my heart.<br>
        2023 was not a good year for you , untill i met you<br>
        you are a dream kanika.<br>
        you felt like a sun in my life , always making me warm with your personality <br>
        i've never met anyone like you , you can make the most depressed person feel hope again<br>
        you're like a cold breeze on a beautfiul sunset, when someone has no worries and holding the hand of someone who loves you the most in the world, a feeling of content , optimism and unconditional love<br>
        i cant see what anyone else sees in anyone but you.<br>
        you have a heart of gold kanika, i know you dont believe it , but ive seen it, you are an angel. <br>
        you're beautfiul , you're kind , you see things and you understand, this world will be a better place if everyone becomes like you a little more<br>
        i wish i could just hold you tightly as i am writing this alone and missing you so badly that i am in tears but its a good thing ig right? i can feel how much i love you and how proud of you i am , every thing you've achieved i've felt nothing but happiness ,i am in love with you deeply, you're a part of me.  <br>
        idk i feel like i've been taking you for granted for a while now im so sorry ,making this , reading old texts just makes me realise how im the luckiest guy in the world to have you and i can and will treat you better<br>
        you've been everything for me this past year and i cant thank you enough , i've always wanted a person who was all mine , my bestfriend , and i found that in you. <br>
        thank you for letting me be your boyfriend its the best thing to happen to me<br>
        and you were wrong , i havnt moved on from you , you werent just a phase you're it.<br>
        I love you<3 <br>
        yours and only yours<br>
